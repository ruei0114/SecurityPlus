### 1. Categories of Security Controls

Controls are categorized by **how** they are implemented.

- **Technical Controls:** Implemented using systems (hardware, software, firmware).
    
    - _Examples:_ Firewalls, antivirus, OS operating procedures.
        
- **Managerial Controls:** Focus on administrative design, policy, risk management, and legal compliance.
    
    - _Examples:_ Security policies, Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), onboarding policies.
        
- **Operational Controls:** Implemented by people rather than systems.
    
    - _Examples:_ Security guards, awareness programs, training, patrolling.
        
- **Physical Controls:** Limit real-world physical access to facilities or hardware.
    
    - _Examples:_ Fences, locks, guard shacks, badge readers.
        

### 2. Control Types

Controls are classified by their **function** or **goal**.

1. **Preventive:**
    
    - **Goal:** Stop an attack before it occurs; strictly limit access.
        
    - _Examples:_ Firewall rules (Technical), Guard checking IDs (Operational), Door locks (Physical).
        
2. **Deterrent:**
    
    - **Goal:** Discourage an attacker; make them think twice (psychological).
        
    - _Examples:_ Login splash screens (Technical), Threat of demotion/firing (Managerial), Warning signs (Physical).
        
3. **Detective:**
    
    - **Goal:** Identify and record an event; may not stop it, but provides alerts/logs.
        
    - _Examples:_ System logs (Technical), Reviewing login reports (Managerial), Motion detectors (Physical).
        
4. **Corrective:**
    
    - **Goal:** Mitigate impact _after_ an event; restore systems.
        
    - _Examples:_ Restoring from backups (Technical), Calling law enforcement (Operational), Fire extinguishers (Physical).
        
5. **Compensating:**
    
    - **Goal:** Alternative controls used when the primary control is not feasible (often temporary).
        
    - _Examples:_ Separation of duties (Managerial), Backup generators (Physical).
        
6. **Directive:**
    
    - **Goal:** Direct behavior; instruct compliance (depends on human compliance).
        
    - _Examples:_ Compliance policies (Managerial), Security training (Operational), "Authorized Personnel Only" signs (Physical).
